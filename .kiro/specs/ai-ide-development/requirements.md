# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a custom AI-powered IDE based on the VSCode codebase. The IDE will be built from the existing VSCode clone, packaged as a desktop application using Electron, and enhanced with AI capabilities that support both cloud-based and local language models. The goal is to create a competitive alternative to Cursor IDE with full control over the codebase and AI integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to build and run the VSCode clone locally so that I can verify the base functionality works before adding AI features.  I want to do what Cursor and WindSurf did and make an AI IDE, that is integrated with AI in all aspects, and uses lmstudio models or ollama models, or llama.cpp, for small things, maybe completions, as well as the coder.  If you want a completely free option, however if you want, you can also use any API key with that model as well if you want.  OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, etc.  We will get the Desktop version working and package it with Electron into an .exe, so I can start having others test it.

We already have cloned vscode, and now we need to finish building, as I have installed the correct node version, as well as the other dependencies from MS Visual Studio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process is initiated THEN the system SHALL compile the VSCode source code successfully
2. WHEN the application is launched THEN the system SHALL display a functional code editor interface
3. WHEN basic editor operations are performed THEN the system SHALL respond with standard VSCode functionality
4. IF build dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what needs to be installed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to package the VSCode clone as a standalone executable so that it can be distributed and run independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the packaging process is executed THEN the system SHALL create a standalone .exe file for Windows
2. WHEN the packaged application is run THEN the system SHALL launch without requiring additional dependencies
3. WHEN the packaged application is tested THEN the system SHALL maintain all core editor functionality
4. IF packaging fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs for troubleshooting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate AI chat functionality into the IDE so that I can interact with AI models directly within the editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI chat panel is opened THEN the system SHALL display a conversational interface
2. WHEN a message is sent to the AI THEN the system SHALL process the request and return a response
3. WHEN code context is provided THEN the system SHALL include relevant file information in AI requests
4. IF the AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to support local language models so that I can use AI features without relying on cloud services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN local model configuration is set THEN the system SHALL connect to locally hosted models
2. WHEN a local model request is made THEN the system SHALL process it without internet connectivity
3. WHEN multiple model types are configured THEN the system SHALL allow switching between them
4. IF a local model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback gracefully or notify the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI-powered code completion and suggestions so that I can write code more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN typing code THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent autocomplete suggestions
2. WHEN code context changes THEN the system SHALL update suggestions accordingly
3. WHEN AI suggestions are accepted THEN the system SHALL insert the code seamlessly
4. IF AI completion fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to standard VSCode completion

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI-assisted code refactoring capabilities so that I can improve code quality with AI guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is selected for refactoring THEN the system SHALL analyze and suggest improvements
2. WHEN refactoring suggestions are provided THEN the system SHALL show a preview of changes
3. WHEN refactoring is applied THEN the system SHALL make the changes while preserving functionality
4. IF refactoring analysis fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback manual refactoring options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure AI model settings so that I can customize the AI behavior for my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing AI settings THEN the system SHALL display configuration options for models and behavior
2. WHEN model endpoints are configured THEN the system SHALL validate and save the settings
3. WHEN AI parameters are adjusted THEN the system SHALL apply changes to subsequent requests
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide validation errors and guidance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI IDE to maintain VSCode extension compatibility so that I can use existing extensions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VSCode extensions are installed THEN the system SHALL load and run them correctly
2. WHEN extensions interact with the editor THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with VSCode APIs
3. WHEN AI features are active THEN the system SHALL not interfere with extension functionality
4. IF extension conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide debugging information

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure handling of API keys and model configurations so that my credentials remain protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API keys are entered THEN the system SHALL encrypt and store them securely
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL decrypt credentials only when needed
3. WHEN credentials are transmitted THEN the system SHALL use secure protocols
4. IF credential storage fails THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-entry without exposing existing keys
